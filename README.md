# financial_instruments

Implements financial instruments such as derivatives and solutions for pricing
as well as for hedging.

(So far only a small portion of what can be done was accomplished, mostly
written in Python. To see the main medium-term goal of the project,
which involves precifying exotic derivatives on assets whose future
possibilities of evolution are modeled by binary trees in discrete time,
look at the what is attepted at "/src py/demos.py".)
